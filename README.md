Next you'll need to create a workspace, to do so run:

```
$ next-es-tools workspace path/to/workspace
```

This will create a new directory (if it does not already exist) containing a single `.env` file. The tools require several keys and settings which _must_ to be added to this file.

```
$ next-es-tools --help
```
